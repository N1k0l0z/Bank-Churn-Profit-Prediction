# E-commerce Customer Churn and Profit Prediction
## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting two key target variables based on e-commerce data:
* Target Event (Churn Event): Identifies whether a customer will churn, defined as "no transaction in a future period."
* Target Actual Profit (Retention Campaign Profit): Estimates the incremental profit generated by retention campaigns in the future, i.e., profit retained or lost based on campaign effectiveness.
  
By developing and testing various machine learning models, this project aims to predict customer churn and the potential profit that can be retained through targeted marketing campaigns.

## Project Structure

1. File: Data_Preprocessing.ipynb
   
Description: This notebook handles the data preprocessing steps necessary for efficient training of machine learning models. Key processes include cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and preparing features for modeling.

3. File: Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb

Description: Provides visual insights into the dataset with exploratory analysis, highlighting key patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables that help in understanding customer behavior and profitability.

4. File: Baseline_models.ipynb

Description: Establishes baseline models for both churn and profit prediction to compare against more sophisticated models.

5. Churn Prediction Models

Logistic Regression: Logistic_Regression_Model.ipynb

Random Forest: Random_Forest_Churn.ipynb

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM_Churn.ipynb

Gradient Boosting: Gradient_Boosting_Churn.ipynb

Adaboost & XGBoost: Adaboost_Churn.ipynb

Ensemble Methods: Ensemble_churn.ipynb (Hard and Soft Voting Ensembles using all models)

Description: Multiple machine learning algorithms are tested for predicting customer churn. The models are evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected. An ensemble approach is used to improve performance by combining predictions from several models using both soft and hard voting techniques.

5. Profit Prediction Models
   
Random Forest Regression: Random_Forest_Profit.ipynb

XGBoost Regression: XGBoost_regression_profit.ipynb

Description: These notebooks train models to predict the future profit generated by retention campaigns, excluding churned customers (as they all have the same profit value of -13). The models are trained on non-churned customer data to ensure accurate profit prediction.

6. Aggregation_of_models.ipynb
   
Description: This notebook combines all models into one final model class, saving the aggregated model for future predictions. For churned customers, the model automatically assigns a profit of -13. For non-churned customers, the model predicts both churn likelihood and future profit.
